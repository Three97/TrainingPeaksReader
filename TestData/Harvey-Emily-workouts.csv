I could tell that my fitness level was less than ideal today.  Felt really good (maybe too good) for the first 4.5+ miles, but by mile 5.5 or so I knew it was going to be a rough day.  I didn't stick to my plan of 9 walk/1 run for the first 39 minutes because I just felt so good I thought I could swing it without taking those walk breaks.  I guess I paid for it later though, because I ended up walking way more than I hoped.  Partially it was because my body just didn't want to keep going, but part of it was because my left glute was flaring up and my left knee was getting sore from the socket trim line.  I think that being out of training for the rib injury lead to my stump changing shape a little bit because I don't remember having that problem in CDA.  Anyways, there were things I could have controlled today that I didn't (like not walking as planned), and things I couldn't control so much, but I definitely got some more experience with having to dig deep and find mental toughness to keep moving through the pain.  Oh, I have a really pretty blister on my right 2nd toe too - I didn't even realize it until I took my sock and shoe off b/c I think all of my brain's pain response was directed to the left side of my body.  My friend Jessica met me about 1/2 mile from the finish line and helped me kick it to the finish line - so that was awesome.  All in all, I'm proud of myself for getting it done and know that I need to work harder on sticking to my game plan and being better about pacing myself on the front end so I don't tank on the back end.*","2.83924669053819","2.09800004959106","","72","","","","","","0.86107278514553","239.36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
